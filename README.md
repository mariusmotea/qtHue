Working:
 - groups on/off, brightness, color temperature, colors(xy)
 - lights on/off, brightness, color temperature, colors(xy) 
 - turn on/off all the lights
 - scenes
 - show [weather](https://openweathermap.org/api) in header and on own weather page
 - customize UI color
 - select time format and tempature unit
 
 ToDo:
   - provide precompiled binaries MacOS (it would be nice if anyone can do that)

Build and tested with my project [diyHue](https://github.com/mariusmotea/diyHue), but must work will oficial bridge and other emulator that work with hue api protocol.
